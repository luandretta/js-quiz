3. From the menu items near the top of the page, select **Settings**.
4. Click on "Pages" in the left hand navigation panel.
5. Under "Source", choose which branch to deploy. This should be Main for newer repositories (older repositories may still use Master).
6. Choose which folder to deploy from, usually "/root".

It can take some time for the page to be fully deployed.
